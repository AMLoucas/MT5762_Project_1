## Introduction & Motivation

 * Are the difference between canabbis grown in stote-bought soil with general outdoor soil.
 * Maybe a chemical composition is specific to soil type.
 
 * Data we interested in is :
  * Sample Name Reference number of the samples.
  * Group -> [Potting mix (pm)] = store-bought, [bhb, mb, nth] = Different location soils in new zealand.
 * Data we are not interested in  :
  * Mg-Th -> Are the 38 chemical elements measured <-- [We only need 5]
  * Reference codes <-- [We do not need them. Delete the column.]


```{r cars}
cannabisData <- read.csv("potplants_MT5762.csv")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
